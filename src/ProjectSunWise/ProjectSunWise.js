          Nowadays, the harmful effect of UV radiation is increasing with
      time as a result of the thinning of the ozone layer. Nevertheless,
      people still seem to ignore or forget the warnings communicated
      by the different media channels. Of course, sun rays have some
      positive effect to humansâ€™ biological system, but the negative effects
      outweigh the positive ones. As an example, being exposed to
      sunshine without taking some precautions can cause temporary
      and permanent eye and skin damage.</div>

          <p>SunWise is designed and developed based on
      the <strong><a href="http://www.personalinformatics.org/docs/lab/2010-chi-ianli-stage-based-model.pdf">Stage-based Model of Personal Informatics System</a></strong>. Its aim
      is to help people realize, be aware and act on the dangers of UV
      exposure.</p>

          <p>The users will
          be driven by motivation to measure their sun exposure patterns.
          The system itself is a mobile platform application.</p>

          <h3>Collection</h3>
          <p>In order to be able to analyze user activity and warn the user for
      dangers, some information is needed to be collected. The system
      has to be aware when the user is exposed to sunshine and how big is
      the UV Index. Therefore, during collection phase the users
      will record their data based on those two variables.</p>

          After initial face-to-face user testing adn problem definition the non-functional protoype was created and tested face-to-face with
          the potential users. The following screens were tested:</div>
          <div className="col3"></div>

        <div className="">
        <div className="row">
          <div className="col7"><h2 className="title">Phase 2</h2><p>Taking into consideration all the issues mentioned above, the
      group proceeded to the second iteration, in which the application
      was redesigned. Apart from implementing the suggestions from
      feedback, we decided that the application has to use principles
      from iOS Human Interface Guidelines.
      The old navigation was replaced with tap bar, which allowed better
      hierarchy of information and application structure. This design
      forced that the title of each screen is shown on the top of the view,
      which helps orientate better where the user is in the application.
      Current UV Index level is displayed in a circular progress bar, instead of a
      simple circle.  Besides the screens that the first
      prototype included, calendar view has been added
      to sum up hours spent on sun during the month.</p></div>
