develop a mobile application that helps its users minimize the sunshineâ€™s
risks while still enjoying its benefits. The application prevents
sun overexposure by allowing users to track the time they
spend outdoors in relation to the UV Index levels. The project was developed as a part of Personal Data Interaction class at DTU."

        longDesc="Even though parallel coordinates can successfully solve
the issue of visualizing multidimensional data, they often lead to
overplotting when datasets are too large, making the visualization
illegible and the underlying patterns undiscoverable. This is a huge
problem since people fail to understand the information hidden in
the data when they see nothing but visual clutter. This project aims to
improve the overall user experience when interacting with parallel
coordinates and presents five types of brushing that are specifically
designed to filter the data in different ways."
