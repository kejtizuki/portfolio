          <p>
            Relatives of dementia pateients usually struggle not only with helping their loved-ones but also with the lack of
            understanding and attention to their own problems that they face everyday. On top of that practical information about
            available help options or smart devices that could be useful is hard to get. They need to know what to ask for and be
            very well-informed in order to get help from the state. The app aims to provide support on emotional and practical level, bridging
            the gap between the caretakers and organizations offering help.

        <p>We put user needs front and center. Everything about the design structure we have made is to make the
        experience as stress free as possible for users. The data that we collect from users needs to serve a purpose. And that purpose is to help them
        find assistance as seamlessly as possible. We provide help on emotional and practical levels. </p>

        <p>First we had to take a look at the available research and used our meetings to understand the scope of what
          we are working with. This allowed for us to begin building our process, creating the structure and flow we wanted
          to utilize.</p>
