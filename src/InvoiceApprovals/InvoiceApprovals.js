      <h1>Automating invoice reviews</h1>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
      Mid-sized companies needed control mechanisms to confidently approve
      and pay invoices without errors.

      Our initial solution required manual reviewer assignment. Finance
      managers had to open every invoice and add reviewers one by one. The process was frustrating and very manual, and it could be clearly automated.
      </p>

      <h2>What I did</h2>
      <p>
      I worked on transitioning the workflow from manual to automatic. In the new system, reviewers are automatically assigned to invoices based on the amount, tags, and team. Worked closely with Review Management team and Design Systems team to introduce the workflow to my area of the product.
      </p>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>The new flow saves time and effort and has allowed us to expand our product offering in Germany. Automated flows were among the most requested features in this market. In October 2024, 19% of companies using invoices relied on manual review flows. By September 2025, 38% of companies were using review workflows â€” 18% still using manual reviews and nearly 21% adopting automated flows.</p>

      <h1>Purchase orders</h1>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
      Purchase orders in company's buying flow is a way to bring more control and certainty to the process. Our customers wanted a way to get their purchase approved before the invoice is sent. This way, they can save time and hussle when invoice is due to be paid.
      </p>

      <h2>Discovery research</h2>
      <p>
      After analysing existing feedback from Productboard I organized 6 discover calls with Finance Managers to understand their workflows. I identified
      patterns in how companies handle pre-purchase approvals.
      I mapped the current workflows and scoped the MVP.
      Before rollout, led 20 alpha tests with customers where we tested implemented solution life.
      </p>
      <h3>Key insights</h3>
      <li>Finance teams needed visibility into commitments before
      invoices arrived, but existing tools were disconnected
      from their payment systems</li>
      <li>Pre-purchase approavals were key to paying invoices on time.</li>
      <li>Finance teams wanted a simple tool allowing them to create purchase order, which then is sent to their Supplier. Supplier sents an invoice which needs to be matched with the PO</li>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>The product is still in beta phase and customers are trying it out. We get ongoing feedback and improve the product to achieve full product-market fit.</p>

      <h2>Layout explorations</h2>
      <p>I explored different layout approaches to organize information in a way that felt intuitive without becoming visually heavy. </p>
      <p>An important part of this process was collaborating with engineers early. Through these discussions, we realized the flow needed to be split into logical steps that aligned with the data model.
      We decided on a two-step approach: create the form first, then add reviewers. This structure worked better technically and made more sense to users.</p>

      <h2>Final layout</h2>
      <p>After few iterations I landed on the final layout. Two step structure provided a simple constraint. The first step was more challenging to design, as it needed to handle much more data than the second one.
      Through user interviews, I tested different information hierarchies to understand what felt most natural. Users gravitated toward a simple progression: general details first, then line items, with address information at the end.</p>
      <p>This sequence matched the mental model of how they think about purchase orders.</p>
      <p>Line items required a lot of horizontal space for comfortable table interaction. I chose maximum width layout to optimise usability. Narrower layouts forced horizontal scrolling which can slow down the data entry and confuse users. </p>
      <p>As the form is quite long, I added a simple fixed header which stays in place while the user scrolls down. This helps them to not loose context and the most important information while filling in the form.  </p>
