      <h1>Automating invoice reviews</h1>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
      Mid-sized companies needed better control mechanisms in order to pay invoices. They give the finance team confidence in paying and avoiding errors.
      I added invoie reviews to Invoices, which meant allowing Admins to manually add reviewers in V1 and building more complex review workflow based on company settings in V2.
      </p>

      <h2>What I did</h2>
      <p>
      I worked on transitioning the workflow from manual to automated. In the new system, reviewers are automatically assigned to invoices based on invoice amount, tags, and team. Worked closely with Review Management team and Design Systems team to introduce the workflow to my area of the product.
      </p>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>The new flow saves time and effort and has allowed us to expand our product offering in Germany. Automated flows were among the most requested features in this market. In October 2024, 19% of companies using invoices relied on manual review flows. By September 2025, 38% of companies were using review workflows â€” 18% still using manual reviews and nearly 21% adopting automated flows.</p>

      <h1>Purchase orders</h1>
      <h2>Problem</h2>
      <p>
      Purchase orders in company's buying flow is a way to bring more control and certainty to the process. Our customers wanted a way to get their purchase approved before the invoice is sent. This way, they can save time and hussle when invoice is due to be paid.
      </p>

      <h2>What I did</h2>
      <p>
      I led the design of our POs product from scratch, leading the entire discovery process, including customer recruitment and interviews. This involved deeply understanding user needs and pain points in pre-purchase controls. I structured and led the conversations with users, then designed the MVP, collaborating with the freelancers team. I guided the team on the usage of our design system components and tested the product multiple times pre-release so that the implementation meets our standards.
      Led the alpha testing with customers and the following product rollout.

      </p>

      <h2>Impact</h2>
      <p>Since February 2025, 48 companies created a purchase order. </p>
